The Ocarina should be able to do the following at minimum:

- Play a "blow" note (blow keys: A, CU, CR, CD, CL)
- Stop a "blow" note
- Change the "blow" note (stop the current note and play a new note)
- Flat or sharp a note (flat/sharp keys: Z, R)
- Bend a note (using axis JD .. JU)
- Apply vibrato to a note (using axis JL .. JR)

If the Ocarina interfaces with MIDI, actions 5 and 6 above are trivial; these 
can be achieved by using MIDI controller messages. 

Additional actions (optional):

Transpose the blow notes
Change the MIDI instrument

Main loop
---------

Do while the instrument is on
	Read controller state
	Compare with old controller state
	Translate Controller state change to Ocarina command
	Do Ocarina command
	Save controller state
Loop

How to choose the currently blowing note from buttons

Simplify the problem: assume there are only 2 blow keys (X and Y).
X, Y = pressed down; x, y = not pressed down

Detect changes in state for the buttons
---------------------------------------

Transitions		Effect
-----------		------
xy - Xy			Blow X
xy - xY			Blow Y
xy - XY			Do nothing
Xy - XY			Stop X, Blow Y
XY - Xy			Stop Y, Blow X
XY - xy			Do nothing

The "do nothing" transitions means that the ocarina will lock up
if more than one button is pressed at the same time.
